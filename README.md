This is a django app that can be added in the INSTALLED_APPS list in your django project settings.py.
Made it an app so that I could add it in my website portfolio

## Summary
A Django web app onto which a machine learning model for detecting heart disease has been deployed so as to provide clinicians with a tool to aid in the early diagnosis of cardiac issues. As a result, it will be simpler to successfully treat patients and prevent negative consequences.

The system uses vast amounts of data that the healthcare sector gathers to forecast the likelihood that patients will develop heart disease. Predictions are made based on these data using variables like age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and obesity. Some advanced machine learning algorithms are utilized to deliver acceptable findings and make wise decisions based on data.

The system's classification algorithms include Support vector machines, Logistic regression, , K-nearest neighbors, Naive bays, and Decision trees. Standard feature selection algorithms like Relief, Minimal redundancy maximal relevance, Least absolute shrinkage selection operator, and Local learning have been used to eliminate redundant and irrelevant features from the system.

## Introduction
A heart attack (Cardiovascular diseases) occurs when the flow of blood to the heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked. From WHO statistics every year 17.9 million dying from heart attack. The medical study says that human life style is the main reason behind this heart problem. Apart from this there are many key factors which warns that the person may/maynot getting chance of heart attack.

## Know about Data

This is one of the most used dataset â€” [Cleveland Heart Disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) from the [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) - and it contains some medical information of patients which tells whether that person getting a heart attack chance is less or more. Using the information we explored the dataset and classified the target variable using different Machine Learning models, finding out which algorithm was suitable for this dataset.

    Angina is chest pain or discomfort caused when your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. <br>
It may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest.
