# heart-disease-detection
A Django web app onto which a machine learning model for detecting heart disease has been deployed

Over the past few decades, heart illnesses have become the leading cause of death worldwide in 
both industrialized and developing nations. The mortality rate can be decreased through early 
identification of heart disorders and ongoing clinical monitoring by professionals.

In this project, we'll get to see how our system uses vast amounts of data that the healthcare 
sector gathers to forecast the likelihood that patients will develop heart disease. We will make 
predictions based on these data using variables like age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and 
obesity. Some advanced machine learning algorithms are utilized to deliver acceptable findings 
and make wise decisions based on data.

The system's classification algorithms include Support vector machines, Logistic regression, , K-nearest neighbors, Naive bays, and Decision trees. Standard feature selection algorithms like 
Relief, Minimal redundancy maximal relevance, Least absolute shrinkage selection operator, and 
Local learning have been used to eliminate redundant and irrelevant features from the system.

The main goal of this research is to provide clinicians with a tool to aid in the early diagnosis of 
cardiac issues. As a result, it will be simpler to successfully treat patients and prevent negative 
consequences.
